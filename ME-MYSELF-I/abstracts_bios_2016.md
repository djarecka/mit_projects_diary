# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2016.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

They're ordered by date of presentation so ideally they're a little easier to find.

### Invited talk in Edinburgh

**Date**: 21st September 2016

**Title**: Structural brain development during adolescence and its relation to psychiatric disorders

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present my work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques: specifically by linking the expression of schizophrenia risk genes to adolescent brain development.

**Bio**: Dr Kirstie Whitaker is a postdoctoral researcher in the Brain Mapping Unit of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. She is a 2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science and a passionate advocate for reproducible neuroimaging research. Dr Whitaker received her PhD in Neuroscience in 2012 from the University of California at Berkeley, funded by a Fulbright scholarship. She is the founder and lead developer of the STEMM Role Models project (www.stemmrolemodels.com) that seeks to ensure conference organisers are able to invite the most exciting and diverse speakers to their event.

### Educated Brain Seminar

**Date**: 27th October 2016

**Website**: http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/event.php?permalink=90241c04cd

**Title**: The (still) developing adolescent brain

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and the prolonged changes are in regions of the brain particularly important for complex cognition. I will begin by orienting the audience to some of the common neuroimaging methods used to study the teenage brain, with a focus on what we can - and can not - determine from these techniques. Specifically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to image non-invasively, and at multiple time points from the same participants as they grow up, but the resolution and biological specificity of the images are limited. I will provide an overview of some key developmental studies that elucidate the flexibility of the adolescent brain, and the impact of socioeconomic status on brain structure in adolescence. I will give a more detailed summary of my recent work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. We found, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. These hubs are located in associate cortex: the part of the brain that integrates information from multiple regions and generates complex action plans. I will conclude with a demonstration of the power of integrating open data sets such as the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques to improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms driving adolescent brain development.

Dr Whitaker received her PhD in Neuroscience in 2012 from the University of California at Berkeley, funded by a Fulbright scholarship. She is a member of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, a Wellcome Trust funded collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London. Her work uses graph theory to study structural brain networks and seeks to explain why so many mental health disorders emerge during adolescence.

### Workshop at OpenCon

**Date**: 13th November 2016

**Title**: How to harness Open to advance your career

**Abstract**: Many (if not all) of the participants at OpenCon are convinced by the moral imperative to work openly. However, paying your rent and ensuring you have food on the table are hugely important! Currently most career progression rewards closed working habits. The only way we will change that culture is to ensure open advocates rise to positions in which they are able to change, for example, hiring and funding criteria. This workshop will crowd source and then discuss various ways in which you can harness open to advance your career. You will leave feeling motivated to continue to working in, or adjacent to, a traditionally closed system, and empowered to change it!
