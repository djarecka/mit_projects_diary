### CamBRAIN NeuroTalks

**Website**: https://cambrainsociety.com/events-2/cambrain-events/

**Title**: Checking your working: a reproducible and replicable neuroimaging study of adolescent brain development.

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. In 2016 the [Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network](http://www.nspn.org.uk/) published a study of adolescent brain development which showed that the hubs of the structural connectome are late developing and are found in association cortex (http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113). Furthermore these regions are enriched for genes related to schizophrenia. In this presentation Dr Kirstie Whitaker will demonstrate how this work is supported by open data and analysis code, and that the results replicate in two independent cohorts of teenagers. She will encourage CamBRAIN members to take steps towards ensuring that their work meets these standards for open and reproducible science in 2017 and beyond.

**Dates**: 9th & 10th March, 2017

**Title**: Longitudinal neuroimaging in UCHANGE: processing update and preliminary results

**Abstract**: Of the 300 participants who completed MRI scans as members of the UCHANGE study, 230 of them have returned for an additional MRI around one year later. In this talk, I will describe the processing pipeline for this data, including the quality control steps for the surface based reconstructions, and the demographics of the participants make up the longitudinal dataset. I will show that the cross-sectional results showing regional variation in the amount of age-related change in cortical thickness and magnetisation transfer (Whitaker\*, Vértes\* et al, 2016) are also present when within-person change is considered. My talk will conclude by describing planned analyses with Dr Simon White using mixed-models to understand the variation in brain structure across and within participants.

**Press release**:
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. In my talk I will discuss recent work by the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network: a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London which seeks to better understand adolescent development in brain and behaviour. I will describe the different types of magnetic resonance images we acquire to better understand changes in the brain’s structure and function. I will also explain our use of graph theory for brain network analysis. The different parts of the brain do not work alone, they are connected to each other and send messages back and forth in order to generate complex thoughts and social interactions. The particularly well connected regions - the hubs of the network - continue to develop throughout the teenage years, and this may be a mechanism to explain the emergence of mental health disorders during the teenage years.

### Endocrine Society


**Website**: www.endocrine.org/meetings/endo-annual-meetings

**Date**: 3rd April 2017

**Title**: Making Connections in the Adolescent Brain

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present findings that adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage are coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. The topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network are located in association cortical regions and have the most pronounced changes during adolescence.

### Invited talk at University of Pennsylvania

**Date**: 20th April 2017

**Title**: Structural brain development during adolescence and its relation to psychiatric disorders

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present my work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques: specifically by linking the expression of schizophrenia risk genes to adolescent brain development.

### Society of Biological Psychiatry

**Website**: https://sobp.societyconference.com/conf_website/c29icC5zb2NpZXR5Y29uZmVyZ

**Date**: 18th - 20th May 2017

**Title**: Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome

**Abstract**:

BACKGROUND
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. The Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (http://nspn.org.uk) seeks to understand biological underpinnings of the adolescent risk of depression and schizophrenia.

METHODS
Multi-parametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14–24 years old. Regional measures at 308 locations across cortex were combined into a structural covariance network and calculated topological measures of degree and closeness centrality extracted. We related nodal measures to regional gene transcriptome data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org). All statistical analyses were conducted using permutation tests with significance set at P < .05 after correction for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
We found that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 years. However, association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. All results replicated in two independent cohorts.

CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that normative human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.

### Talk at Poldrack lab meeting

**Date**: 31st May 2017

**Title**: The logistical and emotional challenges of replicating published work

**Abstract**: Encouraging reproducible research - the sharing of data and code along with published findings - opens up the possibility of investigating how well a finding replicates in independent cohorts. It may not be easy to reproduce what someone has done (their code often is not well documented for example) but I have confidence that the open science community can help on the analysis front. A more challenging frontier is the application of a definition of replication - if the "blob" is in a slightly different location what do we conclude? Finally, however, the hardest challenge may be in dealing with the push-back from the original authors who could perceive "failed replications" as a personal attack. During my allocated time at lab meeting I will present a project proposal to replicate neuroimaging findings, explain the motivations and set up what I see are the major challenges. I hope to stimulate a discussion about the future of publishing replication studies in the era of big, and open, data.

**Date**: 5th-8th August 2017

**Title**: A how to guide to reproducible research

**Abstract**: This talk will discuss the perceived and actual barriers experienced by researchers attempting to do reproducible research in neuroscience, and give practical guidance on how they can be overcome. It will include suggestions on how to make your code and data available and usable for others (including a strong suggestion to document both clearly so you don't have to reply to lots of email questions from future users). Specifically it will include a brief guide to version control, collaboration and dissemination using GitHub as well as a discussion of tools to help you work reproducibly from the start in a variety of programming languages. Exercises and resources will be persistently available after the talk and all ICON audience members will leave knowing there is something they can do to step towards making their research reproducible.


### European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ENCP) Congress

**Title**: Intra-cortical myelination during adolescence: linking MRI networks with gene transcription profiles

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. The Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (http://nspn.org.uk) seeks to understand biological underpinnings of the adolescent risk of depression and schizophrenia. In this talk I will present findings using multi-parametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical thickness and intra-cortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14–24 years old [1]. Regional measures at 308 locations across cortex were combined into a structural covariance network and we calculated and extracted topological measures of degree and closeness centrality extracted. All nodal measures were then related to regional gene transcriptome data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org). We found that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 years, but that association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. All results replicated in two independent cohorts. This work demonstrates that measurements of myelin can be linked across the micro and macro scales to better understand typical and atypical adolescent brain development.
